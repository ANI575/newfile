<P class=font>Electronics comprises the physics, engineering, technology and applications that deal with the emission, flow and control of electrons in vacuum and matter.
This distinguishes it from classical electrical engineering as it uses active devices to control electron flow by amplification and rectification rather than just using passive effects such as resistance, capacitance and inductance.<br> The identification of the electron in 1897, along with the subsequent invention of the
acuum tube which could amplify and rectify small electrical signals, inaugurated the field of electronics and the electron age.<br> This distinction started around 1906 with the invention by Lee De Forest of the triode, which made electrical amplification of weak radio signals and audio signals possible with a non-mechanical device.
Until 1950, this field was called "radio technology" because its principal application was the design and theory of radio transmitters, receivers, and vacuum tubes.<br><br><BR><BR>
</p><a name="MECH"><b><h3>MECHANICAL</b></a></h3><p class=font>echanical engineering is an engineering discipline that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials science to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems.
 It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering disciplines.Most mechanics specialize in a particular field, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning" title="Air conditioning">air conditioning</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigeration" title="Refrigeration">refrigeration</a> mechanics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_mechanics" class="mw-redirect" title="Auto mechanics">auto mechanics</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_mechanic" title="Bicycle mechanic">bicycle mechanics</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiler" title="Boiler">boiler</a>

The mechanical engineering field requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science, structural analysis, and electricity.<br><p class=font>A mechanic is typically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification" title="Certification">certified</a>  In addition to these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM),<BR> and product lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices, weapons, and others. It is the branch of engineering that involves the design, production, and operation of machinery.<br>
<br><br><br><br><p/><a name="CIV"><b><h3>Civil engineering</b></a><br></h3><p class=font>Civil engineering is the application of physical and scientific 
principles for solving the problems of society, and its history is 
intricately linked to advances in the understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics" title="Physics">physics</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>
 throughout history. Because civil engineering is a wide-ranging 
profession, including several specialized sub-disciplines, its history 
is linked to knowledge of structures, materials science, geography, 
geology, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil" title="Soil">soils</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrology" title="Hydrology">hydrology</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_science" title="Environmental science">environment</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics" title="Mechanics">mechanics</a> and other fields.<br><br><br><br>
<a name="CHM"><b></p><h3>chemical engineering</b></a><br></h3><p class=font>CChemical engineers typically hold a degree in Chemical 
Engineering or Process Engineering. Practising engineers may have 
professional certification and be accredited members of a professional 
body. Such bodies include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution_of_Chemical_Engineers" title="Institution of Chemical Engineers">Institution of Chemical Engineers</a> (IChemE) or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Institute_of_Chemical_Engineers" title="American Institute of Chemical Engineers">American Institute of Chemical Engineers</a> (AIChE).
A degree in chemical engineering is directly linked with all of the other engineering disciplines, to various extents.</p>
